# ruby_trie
Pure ruby implementation of a trie structure. A trie is an efficient structure for holding a collection of related strings - classically used for things like autocompletion lookahead and the like.

Ruby-trie maps (fairly closely) onto the fast_trie methods. However, this pure ruby version is based on the ruby Tree gem, so it provides all the underlying Tree traversal methods and other goodness.

Install ruby_trie as agem using

    gem install ruby_trie
